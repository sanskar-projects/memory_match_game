## Memory Match Game

### Project Overview
This project is a web-based memory match game, designed to provide an engaging and entertaining experience for users of all ages. The game involves a 4x4 grid of cards, where each card has a hidden image. The player's objective is to find and match all pairs of identical images by flipping the cards two at a time.

### Key Features
1. **Card Shuffling**: The game starts by shuffling a set of card images to ensure a random and unique arrangement every time the game is played. This adds an element of unpredictability and replayability.

2. **Card Flipping Mechanics**: Players can click on cards to flip them and reveal the hidden images. If two cards with the same image are flipped consecutively, they remain face-up. If not, they are flipped back down after a brief delay, giving the player a chance to memorize their positions.

3. **Match Detection**: The game detects when a pair of cards with identical images is found and keeps them face-up. This functionality is handled through a combination of event listeners and conditional checks.

4. **Win Condition**: The game tracks the number of matched pairs. When all pairs are successfully matched, a "You Win!" message is displayed to congratulate the player.

5. **User Feedback**: The game provides immediate visual feedback to the player by flipping cards and displaying a win message upon successful completion.

### Code Breakdown
The JavaScript code for this project is structured as follows:

- **Initialization**: Upon loading the document, the game initializes by shuffling the card images and creating the game board.
- **Card Creation**: The `createCard` function generates the HTML structure for each card, including both the front and back faces.
- **Card Flipping Logic**: The `flipCard` function handles the card flipping action, ensuring that only two cards can be flipped at a time.
- **Match Checking**: The `checkForMatch` function compares the images of the two flipped cards to determine if they match.
- **Disabling and Unflipping Cards**: Functions `disableCards` and `unflipCards` manage the state of matched cards and reset non-matching cards respectively.
- **Win Message Display**: The `displayWinMessage` function creates and displays a win message when all pairs are matched.

### Conclusion
This memory match game project is a demonstration of fundamental web development skills, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic. The project provides an interactive and enjoyable way for users to test and improve their memory skills.
