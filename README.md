### Project Description

**Project Title:** Memory Match Game

**Overview:**
The Memory Match Game is an engaging web-based puzzle game designed to test and enhance memory skills. Players flip pairs of cards to find matching pairs within the fewest possible moves. This project utilizes JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive and visually appealing user experience.

**Key Features:**

1. **Random Card Selection:**
   - The game dynamically selects 8 pairs of images from a pool of 16 images.
   - Images are shuffled and paired randomly, ensuring a unique game experience every time.

2. **Responsive Game Board:**
   - The game board is created dynamically using JavaScript and displays a 4x4 grid layout.
   - Each card is clickable, allowing users to flip and reveal the card's image.

3. **Card Flip Animation:**
   - Clicking on a card flips it to reveal the image, utilizing CSS transitions for smooth visual effects.
   - If a pair is found, the cards remain flipped; otherwise, they flip back after a brief delay.

4. **Move Counter:**
   - The game tracks the number of moves made by the player.
   - Upon winning the game, the total number of moves is displayed in an alert box.

5. **Win Condition:**
   - The game detects when all pairs have been matched.
   - A winning message is displayed, including the total number of moves taken to complete the game.

**Technical Details:**

- **HTML (index.html):** 
  The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game, including the game board container and linking the external CSS and JavaScript files.

- **JavaScript (script.js):** 
  The JavaScript file contains the core logic of the game, including card creation, shuffling, event handling, and win condition checking.

- **CSS (styles.css):** 
  The CSS file provides the styling for the game, including the layout of the game board and the visual design of the cards. The background features a dark gradient to enhance the visual appeal.

### Conclusion
The Memory Match Game is a fun and interactive way to sharpen memory skills, built using JavaScript for the logic, HTML for the structure, and CSS for styling. This project not only provides entertainment but also demonstrates the power of web development technologies. It has been developed with the assistance of artificial intelligence to ensure a smooth and efficient creation process.
